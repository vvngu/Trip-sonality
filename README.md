## System Architecture

Trip-sonality uses a collaborative AI agent system to create personalized itineraries:

1. **Summarize Agent**: Analyzes MBTI traits and preferences
2. **Search Agent**: Gathers destination information
3. **Web Content Agent**: Collects detailed POI data
4. **POI Activity Agent**: Identifies personality-matching places and activities
5. **Plan Agent**: Creates coherent day-by-day itineraries
6. **Critic Agent**: Reviews for consistency with user preferences
7. **Format Agent**: Produces the final polished itinerary

Our multi-agent architecture is inspired by the [AutoGen MagentiCone design pattern](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos/blob/main/autogen_magenticone.py) from Azure Samples' AI agent frameworks. This pattern enables sophisticated group chat interactions between specialized agents, allowing them to collaborate on complex tasks while maintaining distinct roles and responsibilities.

3. **Choose a theme** - Currently supporting movie-themed trips
4. **Select your destination** - Where would you like to explore?
5. **Define trip duration** - How many days will you be traveling?
6. **Chat about your preferences** - Tell us what you like and dislike
7. **Generate your itinerary** - Our AI agents will create your personalized plan
8. **Explore and refine** - Browse your recommendations and provide feedback
9. **Share or save to calendar** - Export your final itinerary

## The Story Behind Trip-sonality

Trip-sonality was born from our team member Emma's frustrating experience with mainstream travel planners. As an INFJ who values meaningful cultural experiences over tourist hotspots, she found existing platforms created generic, impersonal itineraries that didn't account for her introvert energy levels or respect her budget constraints.

We built Trip-sonality to solve these pain points by creating deeply personalized travel experiences that reflect not just where you want to go, but how you prefer to experience the world.
