## The Story Behind Trip-sonality
In an era where digital services are rapidly advancing toward hyper-personalization, travel planning remains a space where individual experiences are often overlooked. Traditional recommendation systems typically focus on surface-level interests, failing to truly reflect the uniqueness of each traveler. To address this gap, Trip-sonality introduces a travel planning platform that integrates MBTI personality types with budget, duration, interests, and themes to generate deeply personalized itineraries.

## System Architecture

Trip-sonality uses a collaborative AI agent system to create personalized itineraries:

1. **Summarize Agent**: Condenses the traveler’s MBTI traits, interests, and budget into clear, structured points so later agents can focus on the most relevant preferences.
2. **Search Agent**: Finds, filters, and prioritizes points-of-interest and activities that match the traveler’s profile, using external data sources and a personality-tagged POI database.
3. **Web Content Agent**: Builds an optimized day-by-day itinerary from the selected POIs, balancing travel time, activity type, and user energy levels, and formats it into a clear, user-friendly schedule.

Our multi-agent architecture is inspired by the [AutoGen MagentiCone design pattern](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos/blob/main/autogen_magenticone.py) from Azure Samples' AI agent frameworks. This pattern enables sophisticated group chat interactions between specialized agents, allowing them to collaborate on complex tasks while maintaining distinct roles and responsibilities.
